# osx-tweaks

Compilation of the best tweaks for Mavericks and Yosemite.

## Motivation

There are a few scripts that basically do the same (search for "OSX for hackers"),
but they lack some important features:

- the ability to choose which tweak you want to apply individually
- the ability to rollback to the previous value

## How it works?

You can run the script safely, is not gonna change anything without your confirmation.
These are the instruction you'll see if you run the script:

    $ ./osx-tweaks.rb
    This script doesn't make any change without your confirmation.
    You'll be prompted before make any change, you choose what to do: y (Yes), n (No), enter (Skip)
    Do you want to start running the script (y/n)?

## Contribute!

Please, fork and send a pull request if you want to add a new tweak.
Just keep in mind that all the changes should be reversible as the current ones are.
